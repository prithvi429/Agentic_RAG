Agents can be simple or complex, and they can be implemented using various AI techniques, such as machine learning, rule-based systems, or symbolic reasoning.\\n\\nAgents can be categorized into different types based on their characteristics, such as:\\n\\n1. Simple Reflex Agents: These agents react to the current state of the environment without considering future consequences.\\n2. Model-Based Reflex Agents: These agents maintain an internal model of the environment and use this model to make decisions.\\n3. Goal-Based Agents: These agents have specific goals and make decisions based on the expected outcome of their actions.\\n4. Utility-Based Agents: These agents make decisions based on the expected outcome of their actions, and they try to maximize a performance measure or utility function.\\n\\nAgents are used in various applications, such as:\\n\\n1. Robotics: Agents control robots to perform tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and sensing.\\n2. Autonomous Vehicles: Agents control vehicles to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and make decisions in real-time.\\n3. Recommendation Systems: Agents provide personalized recommendations to users based on their behavior and preferences.\\n4.
